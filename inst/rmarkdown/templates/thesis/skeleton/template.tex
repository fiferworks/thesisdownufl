%%%                 User Package and Style File loading.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\usepackage{CustomMacros}%  This is a user macro/style file.

\usepackage{tikz}%       tikz is used by almost everyone, but certainly by me for this.
\usepackage{pgfplots}%   pgfplots is tikz but better.
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.7}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{makecell}
%\usepackage{amsrefs}%   amsrefs contains the .bibtex style content for mathematician papers.

%%%                     User Configuration commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Uncomment the relevant line below if you have tables or figures.
\haveTablestrue%        Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue%       Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.
%\haveObjectstrue%       Uncomment this if you have Objects in your thesis. This is almost certainly not the case however.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair.
%       Most of these are self explanatory.
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair.
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\title{$title$}%  Put your title here.

\degreeType{Doctorate of Philosophy}%   Official name of your degree; eg "Doctorate of Philosophy".
\major{$department$}%                    Your official Department
\author{$author$}%                  Your Name
\thesisType{Dissertation}%              Dissertation (PhD) or Thesis (Masters)
\degreeYear{$date$}%                      Intended graduation year (not the year you submit the thesis)
\degreeMonth{$month$}%                   Month of graduation should be May, August, or December.
\chair[$altadvisor$]{$advisor$}%                   Chair and Cochair (see comment block above).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% For each of the following, type in the name of the file that contains each section.
%       They are assumed to be tex files, but if they aren't the command takes an optional argument for the extension.
%       So, you could load dedication.tex as your dedication file using \setDedicationFile{dedication}
%       You could load dedication.txt instead with \setDedicationFile[txt]{dedication}.
%       NOTE: For some compilers they may or may not add a .tex to the end of the file automatically.
%           If you get a "couldn't find dedication.tex.tex" type error, try the command with an empty optional argument,
%           e.g. \setDedicationFile[]{dedication}
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% These are REQUIRED sections; easiest to do via these commands.

\setDedicationFile{dedicationFile}%                 Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{acknowledgementsFile}%     Acknowledgements Page
\setAbstractFile{abstractFile}%                     Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)
\setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{amsplain}%         References. First argument is your bibtex source file
%                                                       the second argument is your bibtex style file.
\setBiographicalFile{biographyFile}%                Biography file of the Author (you).

%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.

\setAbbreviationsFile{abbreviations}%           Abbreviations Page
\setAppendixFile{appendix}%                     Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird.
\multipleAppendixtrue%                          Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix,
%                                                   comment it if you have only one appendix.

%%%% Here you just need to include/input your actual work.
%       The above files (dedication, acknowledgement, titlepage, etc etc) will all be added for you
%       using the files you assigned above.
%       If you want to input the above files manually you can comment out the \setFILE command above
%       and use \input or \include here. Generally you want to use \include to get your pagebreak.
%       NOTE: If you input manually you will have to do some/all the formatting manually.



\include{chapter1}% Modified from old template.

%\begin{algorithm}% Example showing the weird "algorithm" environment works...
%    \captionof{algorithm}{Test Caption}
%\end{algorithm}
%\addObject{TestStuff!}%     This is probably the command that a normal author will use to add objects.

\include{chapter2}% Modified from old template.
\include{chapter3}% Modified from old template.

\chapter{EXAMPLES OF EDITOR/Author TOOLS, TABLES, AND IMAGES}% Notice that we can use chapter/section etc breaks in the master file if we want, and then use \input instead of \include to avoid unneccessary page breaks.
\input{editorAndAuthorRemarks}%     Stuff about using editorRemark and authorRemark commands
\input{includingTablesExamples}%    Stuff about using Tables.
\input{includingImagesExamples}%    Stuff about using Images.

\include{chapter5}% Modified from old template.
