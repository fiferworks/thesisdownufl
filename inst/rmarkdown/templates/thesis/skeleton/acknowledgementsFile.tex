This is the acknowledgments tex file, which should have been set in the main file using the command \verb|\setAcknowledgementsFile{Drive:/file/location/acknowledgementsFile}|.

Keep in mind this should be written in first person, eg;
``I thank my chair for his patience with my random tangents and endless questions and his subsequent (and often lengthy) explanations. I especially appreciate him refraining from voicing how dumb some of those questions were, despite me feeling like a moron nonetheless."
